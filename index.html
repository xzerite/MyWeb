Hasna has established herself as one of the most unusual students during this time by perfectly fusing outstanding technical proficiency in cybersecurity, a strong sense of ethics, and the ability to contextualize security concerns within cultural and social frameworks. This rare combination has made her a potential security expert who is able to address changing cyber threats with depth and knowledge. Throughout all the courses I have taught, Hasna has consistently shown exceptional academic performance. To promote community cybersecurity awareness that extends beyond the classroom, she has participated in university cultural activities. During Cyber Security Week, she planned a workshop called Cybersecurity and Digital Identity, in which she carefully linked the tenets of privacy protection with Saudi cultural ideals. I can wholeheartedly suggest her for any higher education program (Master's/PhD in Cybersecurity) or professional position in a government or commercial security organization. Investing in Hasna means investing in a new generation of Saudi cybersecurity experts, who will protect the digital environment with a blend of technical expertise, cultural knowledge, and moral accountability."
